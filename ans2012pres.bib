{\textless}p{\textgreater}2.5    Ahn Models[1, 2]{\textless}br {/{\textgreater}Basic} Flowthrough Path Waste canisters are modelled as compartments of waste matrix surrounded by a buffer layer which is in turn surrounded by layers of near field rock and far field rock. Water is introduced to the system at a constant rate, and encounters an array of failed waste packages (at t = 0 in the 2004 model, and at Tf = 75,000 years in the 2007 model). The water immediately begins dissolving the waste matrix. Nuclides with higher solubilities are preferentially dissolved and treated with a ‘congruent release’ model discussed below. Nuclides with lower solubilities are transported through the buffer with the alternative ‘solubility limited release model. The water flow begins at one waste package and travels through the matrix and buffer space to the next waste package, contacting each waste package consecutively and then flowing on into the near field. In this way, the water is increasingly contaminated as its path through the waste packages proceeds.{\textless}br {/{\textgreater}Congruent} Release Model    Nuclides with a high solubility coefficient are modeled with the congruent release model. Nuclides of this type include most of the fission products, but not the actinides. This model states that the release from the waste packages is congruent with the dissolution of the waste matrix and is transported through the rock by advective transfer with the water that flows through the waste packages.{\textless}br {/{\textgreater}Solubility} Limited Release Model Nuclides with lower solubility coeffi- cients are modeled with the solubility limited release model.

This model suggests that a dominant mode of dissolution of the nuclide into the flowthrough water is dominated instead by the diffusion coefficient, which is largely dependent upon the concentration gradient between the waste matrix and the water.

	abstract = {The environmental impact of different fuel cycles based on Pressurized Water Reactor {(PWR)} and Fast Reactors {(FR)} has been assessed and compared. The study has been carried out by coupling two models: a waste conditioning model that determines the composition of the vitrified High Level Waste {(HLW)} and a radionuclide transport model that takes into account the release of radionuclide through the Engineered Barrier Systems {(EBS)} after failure of the canisters of a water-saturated repository. It follows from the study that the environmental impact per electricity generated of a {PWRMOX} system is substantially higher than the ones observed for {PWR-UO{sub} 2} and {FRs.} These differences are to be related to the waste conditioning constraints that determine the dilution of waste radionuclides within the borosilicate glass. A removal of the high heat emitting radionuclides such as Cm-244 is to that regard advisable. Numerical results show that the {PWR} cases studied here are more sensitive than {FR} systems to geologic repository characteristics such as the Canister Failure Time {(CFT).} For short {CFT,} this relatively high sensitivity is mainly due to Am-241.

	abstract = {Fuel cycle scenario analysis codes are valuable tools for investigating the effects of various decisions on the performance of the nuclear fuel cycle as a whole. Until recently, repository metrics in such codes were based on mass and were independent of the isotopic composition of the waste. A methodology has been developed for determining peak repository loading for an arbitrary set of isotopics based on the heat load restrictions and current geometry specifications for the Yucca Mountain repository. This model was implemented in the {VISION} fuel cycle scenario analysis code and is used here to study the effects of separation efficiencies on repository loading for various {AFCI} fuel cycle scenarios. Improved separations efficiencies are shown to have continuing technical benefit in fuel cycles that recycle Am and Cm, but a substantial benefit can be achieved with modest separation efficiencies.

        abstract = {This report presents detailed geologic and hydrologic data that describe shales and other argillaceous rocks; data are from the open literature. These data are intended to be used in the future to aid in assessment of various strata and their potential for repository siting. No observations, conclusions, or recommendations are made by the authors of this report relative to the suitability of various argillaceous rocks for waste disposal. There are, however, other published reports that contain technical data and evaluative statements regarding the suitability of various argillaceous rocks for repository siting. Where appropriate, the authors of this report have referenced this previously published literature and have summarized the technical data. 838 refs., 121 figs., 6 tabs.},
