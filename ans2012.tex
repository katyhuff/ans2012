\section{Introduction}

This work proposes a simple calibrated thermal resistance model to improve the 
accuracy of a rapid homogenous medium analytical transient heat transfer 
solution model. The model to be calibrated, created by \gls{LLNL}, is a solution 
of superimposed line and point source solutions representing a generic geologic 
repository with a gridlike waste package layout in a homogeneous medium. The 
auxillary thermal resistance model improves the model's estimation of the peak 
temperature and peak time. The calibration of this model is undertaken as part 
of a benchmarking effort against a geometrically detailed generic thermal 
repository model based on \gls{SINDAG} software.

Calibrated an analytic thermal repository model from (\gls{LLNL}) model using a 
thermal resistance model and determined appropriate coefficients from 
\gls{SINDAG} calculations.

\subsection{Description of Work}

A benchmarking effort between the analytical \gls{LLNL} model and the 
\gls{SINDAG} \gls{ANL} model revealed a discrepancy between them. The time of 
peak heat arrived sooner and the value of the peak temperature was lower in the 
homogeneous medium \gls{LLNL} model than in the \gls{SINDAG} model. 

The SINDA model is based on a lumped parameter construction that models parts of 
the repository in detail. 

The LLNL model

Calibration was necessary.

Calibration occured for geologies of interest.

\section{Results and Analysis}

The calibration was an improvement on the benchmarking.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}

We recommend that for this and other analytical models of this nature, the 
additional step will improve results near the area of interest.
